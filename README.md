<h1>LearnGit</h1>

<h2>Part One</h2>

Create a file on your computer. This file should be named <your_name>.txt and contain the following information about yourself:

<ul>
  <li>First/Last Name</li>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Favorite Song</li>
  <li>Favorite Food</li>
  <li>Favorite Movie</li>
  <li>Github Username</li>
  <li>LinkedIn Username</li>
  <li>HackerRank Username</li>
  <li>Slack Username</li>
</ul>

Once you have created the file, use git to add it to this repo. You can refer to KalebBurd.txt for an example. 

<h2>Part Two</h2>

Add a ist of goals to the text file you created previously. Create a Pull Request with your changes and add the instructor as a reviewer. 
You are one when the instructor approves your pull request. Do <b>NOT</b> push your changes directly to master.
