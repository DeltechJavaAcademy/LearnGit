<h1>LearnGit</h1>

<h2>Part One</h2>

Create a file on your computer. This file should be named <your_name>.txt and contain the following information about yourself:

<ul>
  <li>First/Last Name</li>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Favorite Song</li>
  <li>Favorite Food</li>
  <li>Favorite Movie</li>
  <li>Github Username</li>
  <li>LinkedIn Username</li>
  <li>HackerRank Username</li>
  <li>Slack Username</li>
</ul>

Once you have created the file, use git to add it to this repo. Add each piece of information above in its own commit. You can refer to KalebBurd.txt for an example. 

<h2>Part Two</h2>

Add a ist of goals to the text file you created previously. Create a Pull Request with your changes and add the instructor as a reviewer. 
You are one when the instructor approves your pull request. Do <b>NOT</b> push your changes directly to master.
